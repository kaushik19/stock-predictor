  sector: "Energy",
  qualityScore: 82,
  qualityGrade: "Good",
  evaluation: {
    evaluation: "Overvalued",
    confidence: "Medium",
    valuationRatio: 1.15
  },
  financialTrends: {
    revenue: { direction: "Improving", strength: "High" },
    profit: { direction: "Stable", strength: "Medium" },
    roe: { direction: "Improving", strength: "Low" },
    overall: "Improving"
  },

    overallRanking: "Above Average",
    overallPercentile: 75,
    rankings: { /* individual metrics */ }
  },

    growth: 90,
    value: 50,
    quality: 95,
    momentum: 75,
    stability: 95
  }
}
```

## 📊 Algorithm Logic

### Quality Score Calculation
```
Overall Quality Score = (Growth × 0.25) + (Value × 0.20) + 
                       (Quality × 0.30) + (Momentum × 0.15) + 
                       (Stability × 0.10)
```

### Evaluation Thresholds
- **Severely Overvalued**: Valuation Ratio ≥ 1.5
- **Overvalued**: Valuation Ratio ≥ 1.2
- **Fairly Valued**: 0.8 ≤ Valuation Ratio < 1.2
- **Undervalued**: Valuation Ratio < 0.8

### Quality Grades
- **Excellent**: Score ≥ 85
- **Good**: 70 ≤ Score < 85
- **Average**: 50 ≤ Score < 70
- **Poor**: Score < 50

### Trend Analysis
```
Trend Slope = (n × ΣXY - ΣX × ΣY) / (n × ΣX² - (ΣX)²)
Relative Slope = Slope / Average Value
Direction = Improving (>0.1) | Stable (±0.1) | Declining (<-0.1)
```
